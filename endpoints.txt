    "vehicle_number": "BBB-857",
    "start_date": "2021-01-14 15:12:12",
    "status": "open"

Used to initiate the SO. The SO id is auto incrementing val. 
And the end date is not given when initaiting the SO.
Thought to update it when closing the SO

>>>PUT - localhost:3000/receptionist/sorder/close
{
    "service_order_id": 1007

This is used to close a service order. The status of the SO updated to "closed"
and end time updated to the current time

****Reminder - Need to validate when updating a already closed SO and entering 
an invalide SO id. 

>>>GET - localhost:3000/receptionist/sorder/getbyid
{
    "service_order_id": 1008
}
